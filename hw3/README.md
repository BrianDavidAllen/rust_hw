"HOLY CRYPTO-SQUARE BATMAN!"
Enjoyed this round of exercise even though the crypto-square took my a huge amount of time. I’m getting better at dealing with Rust’s strings but still can be a pain. Finally starting to feel comfortable and learning to use match statements. If I were to do it all over again I wouldn’t start working on the crypto-square until I had everything planned out (surprise right?) Again, sorry for the delay.
